## The mission

You have to make a website version of the hangman word game. 
To do so try to think the structure, the backend (functionality) and the frontend (design) of your project before you start coding.

At the very least your version of the hangman should:

    propose an hidden word
    allow the selection of letters
    verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
    count the number of failure (lives)
    check if it's a game over
    check if the word as been found

### Optionally it can:

    keep in memory all guessed letters
    only let the player guess a letter once

### Bonus:

    use canvas
